File sharing service

How to Use:
1) First clone the repository into a directory of your choice. 
2) Then add any file into that directory that you want to share. 
3) Edit the server.py script in lines 9&10 to the relative path name of your image.
4) Then run the server and client scripts on different terminal windows. 
5) The receieved image should pop up quickly

NOTE: There is no frontend right now, the file sharing will be simply displayed via terminal and in your folder. A GUI could be coming soon!
